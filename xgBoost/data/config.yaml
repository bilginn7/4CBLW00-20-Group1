## Configuration for XGBoost training and artifacts

# Model hyperparameters passed to XGBRegressor
model_params:
  objective: reg:squarederror   # squared error for continuous target
  n_estimators: 200             # number of boosting rounds
  max_depth: 5                  # maximum tree depth
  learning_rate: 0.05           # shrinkage rate (eta)
  subsample: 0.8                # fraction of rows sampled per tree
  colsample_bytree: 0.8         # fraction of columns sampled per tree
  reg_alpha: 0.1                # L1 regularization term on weights
  reg_lambda: 1.0               # L2 regularization term on weights

# Early stopping configuration
early_stopping_rounds: 50

# Paths for saving models and artifacts
artifacts:
  model_path: "xgb_regressor.pkl"
